# Spotify_database_project
This project involves creating a music system database for managing users, artists, albums, tracks, playlists, likes, and followers in a music streaming service. The schema is optimized for storing and retrieving music-related data efficiently, enabling users to explore music, create playlists, and connect with their favorite artists.
